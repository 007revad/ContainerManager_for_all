### Description

A Container Manager package for RS819, DS119j, DS418, DS418j, DS218, DS218play and DS118

There is no technical reason why these NAS models with Realtek RTD1296 or Marvell A3720 CPUs are excluded from installing Container Manager when they have the same CPU as the DS220j or DS120j which are both supported by the Container Manager package. 

So I made a tiny edit so the package will install on any model with a Realtek RTD1296 or Marvell A3720 CPU running DSM 7.2 or later.

## Download the package

1. Download the latest version .spk file from https://github.com/007revad/ContainerManager_for_all_armv8/releases
2. Save the download spk file to a folder on the Synology.

## How to do a manual package install

1. Open Package Center.
2. Click on Manual Install.
3. Click Browse and browse to where you downloaded the spk to and select the spk file.
4. Click next and install the package.
